      1. Repeatedly:

             -- Seconds to travel
                  -- If this is 0, BREAK out of the loop.
             -- Speed at which to travel (-100 to 100)
             -- Stop action ("brake", "coast" or "hold")
          -- Makes the robot run per the above.
      2. Same as #1, but gets degrees and runs turn_left_by_time.
      3. Same as #2, but runs turn_left_by_encoders.
      4. Same as #1, 2, 3, but tests the turn_right functions.
